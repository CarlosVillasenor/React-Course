We will use the ES6 syntax to propertly work with the this selector,we will also 
call our constants/variables with lowercase, because that is the convention on React.
To add properties to our component we need to pass them as a parameter of our
variable,constant or class, for that we use props which allow you to pass data from a 
parent (wrapping) component to a child (embedded) component. Using Stateless Components
its really usefull because they donÂ´t  manipullate your aplication state
